<center><b>Chainspotting: Transactions</b></center>
<p>This module of Chainspotting allows you to visually track blockchain transactions in real-time, using bar graphs. You can either track individual transactions or specific bitcoin addresses. If you choose the latter, new transactions associated with the address will appear automatically (unless you turn this feature off). Then, as transaction confirmations are posted on the blockchain, the bar graph will automatically update. Transactions will also delete themselves once they pass a user-defined confirmation threshold. Finally, you can view further information about a transaction on <b>blockchain.info</b> by clicking on the bar graph label.</p>
<p>To add either an address or a transaction, click on the <b>+</b> button in the toolbar on the bottom of the screen. You can delete an address or a transaction by using the <b>-</b> button. Keep in mind that deleting an address doesn't delete the transactions associated with the address. It just deletes the creation of further transaction on the graph. Finally, you can clear all data by using the <b>x</b> button.</p>
<p>You can save and load your data in the form of selection sets, by using the up and down arrow buttons. Loading data will clear your current data.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> All user data is saved locally and is not accessible by our server. Additionally, this module uses no cookies or keeps track of users in any way.</p>
<p>By selecting <b>Settings</b> in the toolbar, you can switch between the production blockchain (MAINNET) and the test version (TESTNET3). Doing this though will delete all your current transactions and addresses. Other module settings include the maximum confirmation threshold and whether you want new transactions associated with an address to appear automatically. You can further specify the ringing of a beep on new confirmations (off by default). Finally, you can toggle 3d mode for the graph by clicking the <b>3D</b> button in the toolbar.</p>
<p><i>Custom development of this app</i> and integration of it into your pipeline is available upon request, by clicking the <b>contact</b> button on the top of the screen. You can also view the module's source code on GitHub by clicking the <b>source</b> button.</p>
