<center><b>Chainspotting: Balances</b></center>
<p>This module of Chainspotting allows you to chart balances of a set of bitcoin addresses in real-time, for an array of currencies.</p>
<p>To add an address, click on the <b>+</b> button in the toolbar on the bottom of the screen. You can delete an address by using the <b>-</b> button. Finally, you can clear all data by using the <b>x</b> button.</p>
<p>You can save and load collections of addresses in the form of selection sets, by using the up and down arrow buttons. Loading data will clear your current data and begin the chart anew.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> All user data is saved locally and is not accessible by our server. Additionally, this module uses no cookies or keeps track of users in any way.</p>
<p>By selecting <b>Settings</b> in the toolbar, you can switch between the production blockchain (MAINNET) and the test version (TESTNET3). Doing this though will delete all your current addresses and begin the chart anew.</p>
<p>You can select a currency by using the <b>Currency</b> dropdown list in the toolbar. Changing the currency will begin the chart anew.</p>
<p>Toggling the <b>CONF</b> button in the toolbar will determine whether you are charting total or only confirmed balances, with total defined as "all-time confirmed balance + current amount received in unconfirmed transactions - current amount sent in unconfirmed transactions." Changing the value will begin the chart anew.</p>
<p><i>Custom development of this app</i> and integration of it into your pipeline is available upon request, by clicking the <b>contact</b> button on the top of the screen. You can also view the module's source code on GitHub by clicking the <b>source</b> button.</p>
